## Introduction

This repository is a collection of Java exercises intended for students and developers looking to improve their programming skills. The assignments involve working with arrays, lists, maps, and string manipulation, among other concepts. Each assignment is encapsulated within its respective directory and can be run independently.

## Homework Assignments

### Homework 1

**Objective**: Write a Java program that takes a string input from the console and counts the number of occurrences of each character, displaying the results in a sorted manner using an `ArrayList`.

- **Source File**: [Homework1/src/Main.java](https://github.com/VasfiDOGAN/GelecegeYazilimJava/blob/master/HomeWork1/src/Main.java)
- **Example**: Input: `numan` -> Output: `n2u1m1a1`

### Homework 2

**Objective**: Develop a Java program that compresses a string input from the console by removing duplicate characters and storing the result in an `ArrayList`.

- **Source File**: [Homework2/src/Main.java](https://github.com/VasfiDOGAN/GelecegeYazilimJava/blob/master/HomeWork2/src/Main.java)
- **Example**: Input: `numankaraaslan` -> Output: `numakrsl`

### Homework 3

**Objective**: Implement a Java program that counts the occurrences of each character in a string using a `HashMap` and displays the results in a sorted manner.

- **Source File**: [Homework3/src/Main.java](https://github.com/VasfiDOGAN/GelecegeYazilimJava/blob/master/HomeWork3/src/Main.java)
- **Example**: Input: `numan` -> Output: `n2u1m1a1`
